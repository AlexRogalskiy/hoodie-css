# Development

In order to see what scripts we have available, you can either go through the **scripts** object in the `package.json` directly, or run `npm run` and it will print a nice list of all named scripts and what they actually do.

###Â Process

When building the project, you can start a local server with `npm run dev`.

This creates a local server at *localhost:9000*, opens your browser to that address, and will reload the page when any files in the `dist` folder change, without a full page reload.

Please extend this document as we automate each part of the process.
